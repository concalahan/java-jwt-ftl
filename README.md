# java-jwt-ftl

A simple Spring Boot project which use jwt for authentication.
The code was taken from https://hellokoding.com/hello-single-sign-on-sso-with-json-web-token-jwt-spring-boot/

And I change the code a little bit, so that all the logic can go in one repository.

You need to have a little help from POSTMAN, cause the initial commit still not complete.
